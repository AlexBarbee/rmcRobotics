  <!--<h2>What do we do in Robotics?</h2>-->
  <h2>This is our first year of existence EVER!</h2>
  <p>This year, we are focusing on recruiting members and making sure the team learns the ins-and-outs of robotics. We
    will be doing everything from advertising to writing code; this season will not be boring.</p>
  <h2>Will there be competition?</h2>
  <p>Because we are focusing on building our team this year, we won't be doing any 'official' competition, however we
    may hold club-based mini-competitions! Stay tuned though, as we are planning to officially compete next year!</p>
