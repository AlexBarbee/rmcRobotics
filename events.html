  <h2>Spring Spark 2024</h2>
  <p>Pretty recently, we participated in the Spring Spark! A little explantation on the Spring Spark, it's a newer event
    that Randolph Macon created to show off our various clubs!</p>
  <p>For this event we pulled out our LEGO Mindstorm robots! We took our meetings to create a cool gyroboy robot that
    balances on it's own accord! It senses the colors and changes direction based on that!</p>

  <h2>Among Us Night</h2>
  <p>At the end of April, we hosted our first event! </p>
  <p>Members and new people decided to come by and play Among Us, eat pizza, and just hang out</p>
  <p>The origin of this event is that it was member voted! We had a bot that plays the Among Us theme song and nods his
    head so, we shaped an event around it!</p>
